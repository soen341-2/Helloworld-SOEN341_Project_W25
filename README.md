# SOEN 341 - SOFTWARE PROCESS PROJECT

## OBJECTIVE

The objective of the project is to create ChatHaven, an online discussion platform that allows users to communicate through direct messages, connect with a team at work, or engage with a community. Users can create channels on different topics, share media, and chat with others in real time. The administrator is responsible for assigning users to the most appropriate groups for a better organization. Both users and administrators will have the same interface, but the administrator will have additional privileges.

The platform will feature a clean interface for an intuitive user experience and robust privacy settings to ensure secure conversations. Firebase authentication will be used to manage user logins securely.


## TEAM MEMBERS AND ROLES

To complete this project, our team is divided into two distinct groups. The Scrum Master, Sarah Amani, will ensure that the Scrum process is followed effectively, guiding the team in adhering to the Scrum methodology and keeping the development team focused on sprint goals. The development team consists of Liyan Al-Mosaria, Prathiksha Kandiah, Alexia Mucciacciaro, and Marco Greco. Their role is to work collaboratively so that the backend and frontend of the project align seamlessly while ensuring the efficiency, organization, and maintainability of the codebase. Together, we aim to complete this project by early April while adhering to the given instructions and methodologies.

# UserChannelAssignment

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
