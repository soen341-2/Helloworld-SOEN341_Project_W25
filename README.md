CHAT HAVEN is an online discussion platform that allows users to communicate through direct messages, connect with a team at work, or engage with a community. Users can create channels on different topics, share media, and chat with others in real time. The administrator is responsible for assigning users to the most appropriate groups for a better organization. Both users and administrators will have the same interface, but the administrator will have additional privileges.
The platform will feature a clean interface for an intuitive user experience and robust privacy settings to ensure secure conversations. Firebase authentication will be used to manage user logins securely.
To complete this project, our team is divided into two distinct groups. The Scrum Master, Sarah Amani, will ensure that the Scrum process is followed effectively, guiding the team in adhering to the Scrum methodology and keeping the development team focused on sprint goals. The development team consists of Liyan Al-Mosaria, Prathiksha Kandiah, Alexia Mucciacciaro, and Marco Greco. Their role is to work collaboratively so that the backend and frontend of the project align seamlessly while ensuring the efficiency, organization, and maintainability of the codebase. Together, we aim to complete this project by early April while adhering to the given instructions and methodologies.
